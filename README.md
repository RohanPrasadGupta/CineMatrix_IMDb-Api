# Movie Rating and Review Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Movie Rating and Review Project! <h1> CINE MATRIX </h1> This project was created as part of my journey to learn JavaScript, ReactJS, and various related technologies. The main focus of this project is to utilize the OMDB API to fetch movie data, display it, and allow users to rate and review their favorite movies.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The project is built using JavaScript, making use of its powerful capabilities to create dynamic and interactive components.

- **ReactJS**: I've employed ReactJS to build a responsive and efficient user interface. React's component-based architecture has enabled me to create modular and reusable code.

- **useState and useEffect**: Leveraging the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks in React, I have managed the state of the application and handled side effects, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **API Integration**: The OMDB API has been integrated to fetch movie data dynamically. This has provided real-time information for a wide range of movies.

- **Tailwind CSS**: I've utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, making it easy to create a visually appealing and responsive design without having to write extensive custom styles.

- **Hooks and States**: By using React hooks and managing states effectively, the project maintains a seamless flow of data and updates throughout the application.

# Additional Features
- Watchlist: Users can add movies to their watchlist, creating a curated list of films they plan to watch.

- Personal Ratings: In the watched list, users can manually assign their own ratings to each movie, providing a personalized touch to their viewing experience.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Netlify, allowing for easy access and sharing. You can check out the deployed version <a href='https://delightful-puppy-bf7ffb.netlify.app/'> Here </a>

**Note:** Due to the OMDB API limitations, it may not function as expected in the deployed version. For the full experience, consider running the project locally by following the instructions below.
